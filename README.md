# AI-Assisted Distracted Driver Detection System 🚗🔍  

## Overview  
This real-time **Drowsiness Detection System** enhances **road safety** by analyzing **eye closure duration** and triggering **instant alerts**.  

- **Deep Learning Model**: Classifies eye state (open/closed).  
- **Face & Eye Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's Haarcascades.  
- **Automated Alerts**:  
  - Sends **WhatsApp notifications** after prolonged eye closure.  
  - **Recommends nearby restaurants** with Google Maps redirection.  
- **Multi-threaded Execution**: Ensures real-time response.  

## Features  
✅ **AI-Powered Eye Detection** - Uses CNN-based classification.  
✅ **Automated Alerts** - Sends WhatsApp messages on prolonged eye closure.  
✅ **Google Maps Navigation** - Opens nearby restaurants for driver rest.  
✅ **Real-time Processing** - Captures live video feed & processes frame-by-frame.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyWhatKit, Google Maps API, Overpass API**
